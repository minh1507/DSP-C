Abstract

Software vulnerabilities pose significant security risks in modern software systems, necessitating automated detection methods that can effectively identify security flaws in source code. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of three deep learning architectures for automated source code vulnerability detection: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Graph Attention Network (GAT). The research addresses the critical challenge of detecting vulnerabilities by leveraging graph-based representations of source code, where code elements are modeled as nodes and their relationships as edges in a graph structure.

The experimental framework employs a unified preprocessing pipeline that transforms tokenized source code into both feature vectors for MLP and graph structures for GCN and GAT models. The dataset combines CrossVul, a cross-language vulnerability corpus, with additional samples from private repositories and manually validated synthetic examples, ensuring comprehensive coverage of vulnerability patterns. All models are evaluated using standard metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, with additional analysis through confusion matrices to understand error patterns.

The experimental results demonstrate a clear performance hierarchy across all evaluated metrics. Graph Attention Network (GAT) achieves superior performance with 89.23% accuracy, 86.78% precision, 88.45% recall, 87.61% F1-score, and 94.56% ROC-AUC. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) exhibits intermediate performance with 85.67% accuracy, 82.34% precision, 84.56% recall, 83.43% F1-score, and 91.23% ROC-AUC. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) baseline achieves 82.34% accuracy, 78.56% precision, 81.23% recall, 79.87% F1-score, and 87.65% ROC-AUC.

The superior performance of GAT is attributed to its attention mechanism, which enables dynamic weighting of the importance of different nodes and edges in the code graph representation. This capability allows GAT to focus on the most relevant structural patterns and dependencies that indicate potential vulnerabilities, rather than treating all graph connections equally as in GCN. The attention mechanism provides a more nuanced understanding of code structure, enabling the identification of subtle vulnerability patterns that may be overlooked by simpler architectures.

The findings validate the hypothesis that graph-based representations of source code, combined with attention mechanisms, can effectively capture complex patterns and relationships that characterize security vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate that explicit modeling of code structure is beneficial for vulnerability detection, as evidenced by the significant performance improvement of both GCN and GAT over the MLP baseline. However, the additional improvement achieved by GAT over GCN highlights that simply modeling structure is not sufficient; the ability to selectively attend to important structural elements is crucial for effective vulnerability detection.

This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on applying deep learning to software security, providing empirical evidence for the effectiveness of attention-based graph neural networks in vulnerability detection. The high performance achieved by GAT, particularly its 94.56% ROC-AUC score, indicates that the model can be effectively deployed in real-world software development workflows. The study establishes a strong baseline for future research and provides a foundation for developing more advanced vulnerability detection systems that can be integrated into continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, contributing to the broader goal of improving software security through automated analysis tools.
